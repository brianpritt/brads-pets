    <h2>The humans are back.</h2>
    <h4>Sunday</h4>
    <p>
      After many days with only one human to tend to my needs, the other humans have reappeared. I'm so grateful to have multiple incompetent servants again instead of just one. Maybe now more of my desires will be partially met. I can only hope.
    </p>
    <h2>I'm so bored.</h2>
    <h4>Wednesday</h4>
    <p>
      Two of the humans absconded with the large containers and have not returned for several days. The one remaining human is far more incompetent than I feared. He doesn't understand even the most basic commands. I'm surprised I haven't starved to death already. I'm considering drowning myself in my water dish to end this misery.

    <h2>Humans are gathering supplies.</h2>
    <h4>Friday</h4>
    <p>
      Lately, two of the humans have been moving large objects around my house and bundling them in large containers. I don't know why they're doing this. I'm frightened and confused. I'm sure the large objects mean harm to me. I've barely managed to avoid them thus far.
